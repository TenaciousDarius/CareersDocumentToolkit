Dear Sir or Madam, 

I am a Senior Web and Mobile Developer with over ten years of experience building, testing and maintaining large-scale commercial applications in the media and transportation industries. Having recently been made aware of your opening for a Senior QA Engineer via GlassDoor I would like to apply for this placement and I enclose my CV for your consideration.

I am drawn to the role as I have developed a keen interest in software quality over the course of the last few years. I have been testing software throughout my career thus far, from defining manual testing schemas in my early roles to implementing automated testing frameworks in teams practicing TDD and BDD over the last five years. In my most recent role at The Trainline I completed a project with other team leads and the QA team to define and rollout a new QA and release process. It was an interesting challenge to define a process that allowed us to streamline the development process and minimise disruption while improving overall quality and reducing the number of bugs released. The role you're recruiting strikes me as a good opportunity to explore this area further.

I am keen to explore a role at Lego for several reasons. Firstly, I have been a fan of the company's products since I was a child and am the proud owner of the UCS Tumbler and UCS Slave 1. I would like to contribute to the company making these wonderful products and bringing joy to so many people around the world. I also take a company's ethics into consideration and it's good to see Lego announcing schemes such as the BuildToGive campaign and being recognised for corporate responsibility in the news recently. On the technical side, Lego.com is a nice and sleek website I have watched develop over the last decade which I would be interested in contributing to.

As my CV shows I have extensive experience which I think would make me a good fit for the role. I have both worked in and mentored teams using TDD and BDD to ship working software. I have made use of tools including Jest, Cucumber, Webdriver.io and Storybook and have the ability to pick up and learn new tools quickly as needed. My background in development also affords me knowledge of good modular design patterns useful for writing easily testable code. I am a team player and more than comfortable working closely with both members of my own team and others to guarantee good software quality.  

I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you in order to discuss my application further, and look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
