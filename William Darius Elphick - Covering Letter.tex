Dear Mr Fleming, 

{\bf Graduate Java Developer} 

I am currently in the final year of a MEng (Hons) Software Engineering degree. Having been made aware of your advertisement recently by the Computer Science department at Aberystwyth University, I would like to apply for the above placement and I enclose my CV for your consideration. 
 
During my degree I have gained an understanding of the principles which surround good quality, sustainable software development. This includes an appreciation of the theoretical concepts involved in managing the project lifecycle and designing systems, as well as technical knowledge for implementing applications using appropriate tools. My volunteering work at software development conferences, including FOSDEM and iOSDevUK, reflects my interest in creating cutting edge applications and the prospect of applying my knowledge in a commercial setting has attracted me to the placement.   
 
A placement with SyQic Ltd would provide a challenging and valuable opportunity to learn from the experience of an international industry leader. The recent release of your YooMob mobile TV service and it's subsequent success are of particular interest to me, and I would be fascinated to learn about the technical challenges which emerged when integrating this product with your existing Yoonic IPTV platform. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute the knowledge I have gained developing mobile apps for my dissertation project and whilst on work experience placement during the summer of 2011.  

As indicated by the modules included on my CV, I have a strong academic background in both computer science and information studies and have attained an average 1st class on my course to date. In order to achieve this I have exercised significant organisational and time management skills to balance my work and meet all deadlines, while reserving time for extra curricular activities such as training at a local Karate club. I have developed effective team-working skills both from group projects conducted as part of my degree and also from several work placements I have undertaken with the Welsh Unitary Authority Cyngor Gwynedd Council. I was pleased to have an opportunity during this work experience to build on my communication and negotiation abilities by interacting on a daily basis with users of the software I was developing and meeting with stakeholders to discuss improvements and expansions to current functionality. 

I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you in order to discuss my application further, and look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
